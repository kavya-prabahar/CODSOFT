This repository contains the task files and datasets used during my virtual internship at CodSoft. Each task is implemented as a Jupyter notebook, and the corresponding CSV files used for the projects are included. Below are the descriptions of the tasks completed during the internship.

**Task Descriptions**

**Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction**

**Objective:** Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
**Dataset:** The dataset contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

**Notebook:** Task 1.ipynb
**Dataset:** Titanic Dataset.csv

**Task 3: Iris Flower Classification**

**Objective:** Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
**Dataset:** The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements.

**Notebook:** Task 3.ipynb
**Dataset:** Iris.csv

**Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python**

**Objective:** Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
**Dataset:** This project uses a dataset containing various factors that influence sales, allowing the development of a model to predict future sales.

**Notebook:** Task 4.ipynb
**Dataset:** sales.csv

**Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection**

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. This involves preprocessing and normalizing the transaction data, handling class imbalance issues, and training a classification algorithm.
**Dataset:** The dataset includes transaction data labeled as fraudulent or genuine.
